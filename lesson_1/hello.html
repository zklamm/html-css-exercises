  <h1>Hello, Internet!</h1>

  <p>
    Welcome to my website! It's a work in progress as I learn <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong> from a <em>terrific</em> class I'm taking at <a href="https://launchschool.com">Launch School</a>. I'm learning a lot! Why don't you join me?
  </p>

  <p class="more-text">
    There's a lot of material on this page as I'm playing around with HTML &amp; CSS. When I'm done, these last two paragraphs will take on a lighter color than the first - the "class" attribute on the two &lt;p&gt; tags and a bit of CSS will help accomplish that.
  </p>

  <p class="more-text" id="final-paragraph">
    This is the final paragraph. It also uses the 'class' attribute as well as an 'id' attribute. We'll use some CSS and the 'id' attribute to underline the entire paragraph.
  </p>
